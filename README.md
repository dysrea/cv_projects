# My Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains several Python projects demonstrating key concepts in computer vision using OpenCV.

## Projects

1.  **Color Tracker**: A real-time script to track objects based on their color in a live webcam feed.
2.  **Document Scanner**: Scans a document from an image, correcting for perspective to create a top-down view. (Wide scope of improvement)
3.  **Face & Eye Detector**: Uses Haar Cascades to detect human faces and eyes in real-time. (As of now, only detects front face)
4.  **Panorama Stitcher**: Stitches multiple overlapping images together to create a wide panoramic view.
5.  **Motion Detector**: A real-time motion detection system built with Python and OpenCV. This application monitors a live webcam feed to identify and highlight moving objects by drawing a bounding box around them.
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy`
3. Run any project script: `python pano.py`
